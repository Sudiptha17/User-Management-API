# User Management API

This is an ASP.NET Core Web API project for managing users.  
It includes CRUD endpoints, validation, and middleware enhancements.

## Features
- CRUD endpoints (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for user management
- Input validation to accept only valid user data
- Middleware implementation (logging/auth support)
- Copilot-assisted debugging and improvements

## Endpoints (Example)
- GET /api/users
- GET /api/users/{id}
- POST /api/users
- PUT /api/users/{id}
- DELETE /api/users/{id}

## Copilot Summary
Microsoft Copilot helped generate the CRUD structure, debug errors, improve validation logic, and assist with adding middleware for logging and cleaner request handling.
